Making the Website structure Excalidraw

![alt text](<images/Screenshot 2024-05-31 131541.png>)

I used a Whiteboard app called Excalidraw to make this diagram showing the different pages that I want in my website and the arrows showing what part of the website can go to different pages. I looked at different shopping type websites and used different pages that they would have in those types of websites.


I chose to take the payment part out of the design because it would be too hard to implement

### 08/06/2024

Meeting my end user Jess at Mapua wharf and showing her my figma design

Here is the images I showed Jess(My End User) and I asked her some questions about how I can improve the website and some features I could add in the final design

> Q1: What colors/ color palets where you thinking you would like to have for your website

> A1: I would like to have pastel colors, I want it to be colorful.

> Q2: Should I have a option for different color options for the products so if a customer wants a different color seal for example they could choose a color so you know which color wool to use

> A2: Yes, that would be a great idea.

> Q3: What do you wanna call your website?
    
> A3: Jess's Crochet
    
> Q4: Is there anything you would like to add to the design?
    
> A4: I was thinking about having a picture of my stall from the easter fair on the top of the home page.![alt text](images/IMG-20240608-WA0000.jpg)

 I Asked Jess these questions and she gave me some good feedback which I will implement into the design. I also explained that I will have to tweak the website a bit because I cant do the payment feature.
