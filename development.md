Making the Website structure Excalidraw

![alt text](<images/Screenshot 2024-05-31 131541.png>)

I used a Whiteboard app called Excalidraw to make this diagram showing the different pages that I want in my website and the arrows showing what part of the website can go to different pages. I looked at different shopping type websites and used different pages that they would have in those types of websites.


I chose to take the payment part out of the design because it would be too hard to implement

Meeting my end user Jess at Mapua wharf and showing her my figma design

Here is the images I showed Jess(My End User) and I asked her some questions about how I can improve the website and some features I could add in the final design

> Q1: What colors/ color palets where you thinking you would like to have for your website

> A1: I would like to have pastel colors, I want it to be colorful.

> Q2: Should I have a option for different color options for the products so if a customer wants a different color seal for example they could choose a color so you know which color wool to use
    
> A2: Yes, that would be a great idea.

> Q3: What do you wanna call your website?
    
> A3: Jess's Crochet
    
> Q4: Is there anything you would like to add to the design?
    
> A4: I was thinking about having a picture of my stall from the easter fair on the top of the home page.

 I Asked Jess these questions and she gave me some good feedback which I will implement into the design. I also explained that I will have to tweak the website a bit because I cant do the payment feature.
