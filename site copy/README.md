# Pages Folder (the project Root folder)

This is the place for any full-page content such as the home page and any other 'normal' pages.

Each page will need to include the various partials required to create a valid HTML page.

## Naming

Generally, you will want to name the files after the page they represent, e.g. *index.php*, or *contact.php*.

However, as your application grows, it would be helpful if you adopt a consitent naming system, something like: **type**-**name**.php or **type**-**name**-**action**.php

- **Type** might be: form, list, details, etc.
- **Name** is the name of the thing(s) that component congtains: users, product, etc.
- **Action** is what the component will do when interacted with: create, update, delete, etc.

For example:

- *list-users.php*
- *list-products.php*
- *details-product.php*
- *form-user-new.php*
- *form-user-update.php*
